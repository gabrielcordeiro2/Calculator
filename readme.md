# Calculator
It's a simple interactive calculator with (+) (-) (ร) (รท) operations.
  
# The idea
Special thanks to my friend [John Erick](https://github.com/johnerick-py), together we turned the idea into an app.

One of the biggest challenges we faced was in the code refactoring, where we had to transform all the logic already created to OOP, in addition to making the calculator perform numerical expressions.
